When I see people throwing away things we could use.”  —Mother Teresa     Waste Disposal  Waste disposal create environmental stress, and the United States is the largest producer of solid waste on the earth. We produce about forty-one pounds of solid waste per person, per day, and there is just little to no room left in which to put our garbage.   In developing nations, garbage is dumped in the open, which speeds decomposition. Air and rain carry contaminants into the groundwater, and fires pollute the atmosphere. In developed nations, sanitary landfills have been create, but there are not many sites left. In the United States, twelve states send their garbage to other states for disposal. It is trucked or sent by train and is an expensive process. In addition, more-developed nations pay countries like Latin America, Asia, and Africa to take their hazardous waste. The problem is that many of these nations cannot treat the waste properly. The United States government runs special landfills for radioactive wastes; however, two of these landfills are already filled. It is also dangerous to transport radioactive wastes to the landfills because securing the cargo and keeping it from falling into the wrong hands is hard.   In the near future, disposing of garbage will be on a fee-only basis, and a very expensive fee will reflect the scarcity of landfill sites and the difficulty of transporting water from one place to another. It is a basic law of science; \"matter can neither be created or destroyed.\"  Learning Opportunities:  1. Look at the three definitions of waste and identify the differences:  waste - refuse from places of human and animal habitats waste useless material to be thrown away waste - a resource that can be recycled 2. Read through the background information on waste: Waste Disposal Background Information.pdf  3. Read A Nasty Business: A Nasty Business.pdf      4. Create a Digital Display (PPT, Google Slides, Canva, etc) for the following activities:   Research and Report on the types of pollution caused by dumping and burning waste. Research and Report on the successes and failures of  the 1980 Superfund legislation. Research and Report on the problems of Love Canal, New York. Research and Report on how the waste created by discarding old cars is used.  Research and Report on what a town like Churchill on Hudson Bay, Canada, does to solve its waste problem.

When we look at institutions throughout human history, we seen that they have been used to promote social and political agendas. For instance the totalitarian regimes of the world have immediately revised the education policy and curricula to reflect their party platform.

Saving our oceans & seas is important to all of us. A healthy ecosystem matters. But how can we best do that and balance the needs of humans as well? Thirty years ago, New Zealand's fisheries—along with much of the rest of the world's—were on the brink of disaster. Overfishing led to declining fish populations. Something had to change. The result? The Quota Management System, or QMS. Today commercial fishing off New Zealand provides fish for consumers worldwide, an excellent livelihood for fishers, and a stronger, healthier ocean and fish population. How does it work?

If everything you see is rooted in your own identity, that becomes difficult or impossible.\"   - Eli Pariser     Think Globally, Act Locally  Think globally, act locally is a principle that everyone can apply. It asks everyone, from governments and businesses to students and citizens, to consider the global impact of their actions.

Are plastics a miracle or a catastrophe?   Netflix's History 101: Plastics is a crash course in how this ubiquitous material came to dominate our lives in less than a century, the damage it's caused, and how we can fix it.  Plastics make modern life possible. From life-saving medical devices to the humble grocery bag, the material is a part of nearly every object we touch, use, and wear. But for all the good plastic does, humanity has seen its harmful side-effects in just a few short decades. It takes hundreds of years for plastic to disintegrate. But instead of recycling, much of it ends up in the ocean, where it kills wildlife and enters our food chain and therefore, our bodies.
